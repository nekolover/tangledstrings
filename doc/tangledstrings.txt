1. INTRO                                                 *TangledStringsIntro*

TangledStrings is a small plugin which attempts to warn the user if a file 
they are editing is being managed by Puppet. For more information on Puppet, 
see:

	http://www.puppetlabs.com/

By warning the user about editing a Puppet-managed file, confusion and 
frustration can be avoided because the file won't be replaced the next time 
Puppet runs.

TangledStrings has two ways it can alert the user - messages and |statusline|.
By default it will use messages, but this can be disabled and the |statusline|
can be enabled with something like:

	set statusline=%{TangledStringsState()}


==============================================================================
2. CONFIGURATION-OPTIONS                               *TangledStringsOptions*

Here are the available configuration options and their defaults:
>
	let g:tangledstringsAlerts = 0
	let g:tangledstringsWarnTxt = "WARNING: PUPPED MANAGED FILE"
	let g:tangledstringsNormTxt = ""


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1                                                  *g:tangledstringsWarnTxt*

This is the text that will be displayed when TangledStrings believes the 
current file is managed by Puppet and thus probably shouldn't be edited.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2                                                  *g:tangledstringsNormTxt*

This is the text that will be displayed when TangledStrings does not believe
that the current file is managed by Puppet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3                                                   *g:tangledstringsAlerts*

When this option is enabled, TangledStrings will attempt to display messages
to the user when they are opening/reading a file which is managed by Puppet.

This option is enabled by default, but you can disable it like so:
>
	let g:tangledstringsAlerts = 0


==============================================================================
